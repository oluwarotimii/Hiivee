Single Sign-On (SSO):
HiiveAPI uses GitHub for Single Sign-On. Follow these steps to set up GitHub authentication:

Create a GitHub OAuth App:

Visit your GitHub account settings.
Navigate to "Developer settings" > "OAuth Apps" > "New OAuth App".
Fill in the required fields:
Application name: Choose a name for your app.
Homepage URL: http://localhost:3000 (or your app's URL).
Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback (or your callback URL).
Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret.

In your project, create a .env file at the root and add your GitHub credentials:

env
Copy code
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
Make sure to replace your_github_client_id and your_github_client_secret with the values you obtained from GitHub.

Usage
Start the development server:

bash

npm run start
or with Yarn:

bash

yarn start
This will start both the React frontend and the Node.js backend.

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
